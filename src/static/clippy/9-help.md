# Getting help

You can get help about any command by typing `help [command]` in command mode. Additionally,

-   If you want to know what a key is bound to, you can simply type `bind [key]` and you will be told the ex command. You can also use `help [key]`, which will jump to the help section of the command [key] is bound to.
-   You can view all of your config on `viewconfig` (but Tridactyl can't run on this page: `Alt-LeftArrow` will get you back to your previous page).
-   If you want to know the value of a setting, `get [setting]`, for example `get nmaps`. You can learn more about what effect a setting has by using `help [setting]`.
-   We have a [wiki](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/wiki) which anyone can contribute to.
-   If you're not sure how to do something, try `apropos [search term]`. The completions for this search through all of our help pages.

If Tridactyl doesn't work or breaks pages we have a [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/blob/master/doc/). If none of the steps described in solve your problems, do not hesitate to open a new issue.

Lastly, you can contact the developers via Matrix or GitHub, as mentioned on the new tab page.

This concludes the tutorial. If you have any feedback, please leave it on [the relevant GitHub issue](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/380). <a href='./8-marks.md' rel="prev"></a>
