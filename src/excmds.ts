/** # Tridactyl help page

    Use `:help <excmd>` or scroll down to show [[help]] for a particular excmd. If you're still stuck, you might consider reading through the [:tutor](/static/clippy/1-tutor.html) again.

    The default keybinds and settings can be found [here](/static/docs/classes/_src_lib_config_.default_config.html) and active binds can be seen with `:viewconfig nmaps` or with [[bind]].

    Tridactyl also provides a few functions to manipulate text in the command line or text areas that can be found [here](/static/docs/modules/_src_lib_editor_.html). There are also a few commands only available in the command line which can be found [here](/static/docs/modules/_src_commandline_frame_.html).

    ## How to use this help page

    Every function (excmd) on this page can be called via Tridactyl's command line which we call "ex". There is a slight change in syntax, however. Wherever you see:

    `function(arg1,arg2)`

    You should instead type

    `function arg1 arg2` into the Tridactyl command line (accessed via `:`)

    A "splat" operator (...) means that the excmd will accept any number of space-delimited arguments into that parameter.

    Above each function signature you will see any aliases or key sequences bound to it. The internal names for the various modes are used, which are listed here:

        - `nmaps`: normal mode binds
        - `imaps`: insert mode binds
        - `inputmaps`: input mode binds
        - `ignoremaps`: ignore mode binds
        - `exaliases`: aliases in the command mode
        - `exmaps`: commandline mode binds

    At the bottom of each function's help page, you can click on a link that will take you straight to that function's definition in our code.

    You do not need to worry about types. Return values which are promises will turn into whatever they promise to when used in [[composite]].

    ## Caveats
    There are some caveats common to all webextension vimperator-alikes:

    - To make Tridactyl work on addons.mozilla.org and some other Mozilla domains, you need to open `about:config`, run [[fixamo]] or add a new boolean `privacy.resistFingerprinting.block_mozAddonManager` with the value `true`, and remove the above domains from `extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains`.
    - Tridactyl can't run on about:\*, some file:\* URIs, view-source:\*, or data:\*, URIs.
    - To change/hide the GUI of Firefox from Tridactyl, you can use [[guiset]] with the native messenger installed (see [[native]] and [[installnative]]). Alternatively, you can edit your userChrome yourself.

    ## Getting help

    For more information, and FAQs, check out our [readme][2] and [troubleshooting guide][3] on github.

    Tridactyl is in a pretty early stage of development. Please report any issues and make requests for missing features on the GitHub [project page][1]. You can also get in touch using Matrix, Gitter, or IRC chat clients:

    `-a`: look for an alias
    `-b`: look for a binding
    `-e`: look for an ex command
    `-s`: look for a setting

    If the keyword you gave to `:help` is actually an alias for a composite command (see [[composite]]) , you will be taken to the help section for the first command of the pipeline. You will be able to see the whole pipeline by hovering your mouse over the alias in the "exaliases" list. Unfortunately there currently is no way to display these HTML tooltips from the keyboard.

 * Open a URL made by modifying the current URL
 *
 * There are several modes:
 *
 * * Text replace mode:   `urlmodify -t <old> <new>`
 *
 *   Replaces the first instance of the text `old` with `new`.
 *      * `http://example.com` -> (`-t exa peta`) -> `http://petample.com`
 *
 * * Regex replacment mode: `urlmodify -r <regexp> <new> [flags]`
 *
 *   Replaces the first match of the `regexp` with `new`. You can use
 *   flags `i` and `g` to match case-insensitively and to match
 *   all instances respectively
 *      * `http://example.com` -> (`-r [ea] X g`) -> `http://XxXmplX.com`
 *
 * * Query set mode: `urlmodify -s <query> <value>`
 *
 *   Sets the value of a query to be a specific one. If the query already
 *   exists, it will be replaced.
 *      * `http://e.com?id=abc` -> (`-s foo bar`) -> `http://e.com?id=abc&foo=bar
 *
 * * Query replace mode: `urlmodify -q <query> <new_val>`
 *
 *   Replace the value of a query with a new one:
 *      * `http://e.com?id=foo` -> (`-q id bar`) -> `http://e.com?id=bar
 *
 * * Query delete mode: `urlmodify -Q <query>`
 *
 *   Deletes the given query (and the value if any):
 *      * `http://e.com?id=foo&page=1` -> (`-Q id`) -> `http://e.com?page=1`
 *
 * * Graft mode: `urlmodify -g <graft_point> <new_path_tail>`
 *
 *   "Grafts" a new tail on the URL path, possibly removing some of the old
 *   tail. Graft point indicates where the old URL is truncated before adding
 *   the new path.
 *
 *   * `graft_point` >= 0 counts path levels, starting from the left
 *   (beginning). 0 will append from the "root", and no existing path will
 *   remain, 1 will keep one path level, and so on.
 *   * `graft_point` < 0 counts from the right (i.e. the end of the current
 *   path). -1 will append to the existing path, -2 will remove the last path
 *   level, and so on.
 *
 *   ```text
 *   http://website.com/this/is/the/path/component
 *   Graft point:       ^    ^  ^   ^    ^        ^
 *   From left:         0    1  2   3    4        5
 *   From right:       -6   -5 -4  -3   -2       -1
 *   ```
 *
 *   Examples:
 *
 *   * `http://e.com/issues/42` -> (`-g 0 foo`) -> `http://e.com/foo`
 *   * `http://e.com/issues/42` -> (`-g 1 foo`) -> `http://e.com/issues/foo`
 *   * `http://e.com/issues/42` -> (`-g -1 foo`) -> `http://e.com/issues/42/foo`
 *   * `http://e.com/issues/42` -> (`-g -2 foo`) -> `http://e.com/issues/foo`
 *
 * @param mode      The replace mode:
 *  * -t text replace
 *  * -r regexp replace
 *  * -s set the value of the given query
 *  * -q replace the value of the given query
 *  * -Q delete the given query
 *  * -g graft a new path onto URL or parent path of it
 * @param replacement the replacement arguments (depends on mode):
 *  * -t <old> <new>
 *  * -r <regexp> <new> [flags]

    This re-executes the last *exstr*, not the last *excmd*. Some excmds operate internally by constructing and evaluating exstrs, others by directly invoking excmds without going through the exstr parser. For example, aucmds and keybindings evaluate exstrs and are repeatable, while commands like `:bmarks` directly invoke `:tabopen` and you'll repeat the `:bmarks` rather than the internal `:tabopen`.

    It's difficult to execute this in the background script (`:jsb`, `:run_excmd`, `:autocmd TriStart`, `:source`), but if you you do, it will re-execute the last exstr that was executed in the background script. What this may have been is unpredictable and not precisely encouraged.

/** Bind a sequence of keys to an excmd or view bound sequence.

    This is an easier-to-implement bodge while we work on vim-style maps.

    Examples:

        - `bind G fillcmdline tabopen google`
        - `bind D composite tabclose | tab #` -> close current tab and switch to most recent previous tab
        - `bind j scrollline 20`
        - `bind F hint -b`

    You can view binds by omitting the command line:

        - `bind j`
        - `bind k`

    You can bind to modifiers and special keys by enclosing them with angle brackets, for example `bind <C-\>z fullscreen`, `unbind <F1>` (a favourite of people who use TreeStyleTabs :) ), or `bind <Backspace> forward`.

    Modifiers are truncated to a single character, so Ctrl -> C, Alt -> A, and Shift -> S. Shift is a bit special as it is only required if Shift does not change the key inputted, e.g. `<S-ArrowDown>` is OK, but `<S-a>` should just be `A`.

    You can view all special key names here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values

    Use [[composite]] if you want to execute multiple excmds. Use
    [[fillcmdline]] to put a string in the cmdline and focus the cmdline
    (otherwise the string is executed immediately).

    You can bind to other modes with `bind --mode={insert|ignore|normal|input} ...`, e.g, `bind --mode=insert emacs qall` (NB: unlike vim, all preceeding characters will not be input).

/** Automatically open a domain and all its subdomains in a specified container.
 *
 *  For declaring containers that do not yet exist, consider using `auconscreatecontainer true` in your tridactylrc.
 *  This allows tridactyl to automatically create containers from your autocontain directives. Note that they will be random icons and colors.
 *
 * ** NB: This is an experimental feature, if you encounter issues please create an issue on github. **
 *
 *  The domain is passed through as a regular expression so there are a few gotchas to be aware of:
 *  * Unescaped periods will match *anything*. `autocontain google.co.uk work` will match `google!co$uk`. Escape your periods or accept that you might get some false positives.
 *  * You can use regex in your domain pattern. `autocontain google\,(co\.uk|com) work` will match either `google.co.uk` or `google.com`.
 *
 * This *should* now peacefully coexist with the Temporary Containers and Multi-Account Containers addons. Do not trust this claim. If a fight starts the participants will try to open infinite tabs. It is *strongly* recommended that you use a tridactylrc so that you can abort a sorceror's-apprentice scenario by killing firefox, commenting out all of autocontainer directives in your rc file, and restarting firefox to clean up the mess. There are a number of strange behaviors resulting from limited coordination between extensions. Redirects can be particularly surprising; for example, with `:autocontain will-redirect.example.org example` set and `will-redirect.example.org` redirecting to `redirected.example.org`, navigating to `will-redirect.example.org` will result in the new tab being in the `example` container under some conditions and in the `firefox-default` container under others.

        - -; focus an element
        - -# yank an element's anchor URL to clipboard
        - -c [selector] hint links that match the css selector
          - `bind ;c hint -c [class*="expand"],[class="togg"]` works particularly well on reddit and HN
        - -f [text] hint links and inputs that display the given text
          - `bind <c-e> hint -f Edit`
        - -w open in new window
        - -wp open in new private window
        - -z scroll an element to the top of the viewport
        - `-pipe selector key` e.g, `-pipe a href` returns the key. Only makes sense with `composite`, e.g, `composite hint -pipe * textContent | yank`. If you don't select a hint (i.e. press <Esc>), will return an empty string.
        - `-W excmd...` append hint href to excmd and execute, e.g, `hint -W exclaim mpv` to open YouTube videos.
        - -q* quick (or rapid) hints mode. Stay in hint mode until you press <Esc>, e.g. `:hint -qb` to open multiple hints in the background or `:hint -qW excmd` to execute excmd once for each hint. This will return an array containing all elements or the result of executed functions (e.g. `hint -qpipe a href` will return an array of links).
        - -J* disable javascript hints. Don't generate hints related to javascript events. This is particularly useful when used with the `-c` option when you want to generate only hints for the specified css selectors. Also useful on sites with plenty of useless javascript elements such as google.com
          - For example, use `bind ;jg hint -Jc .rc > .r > a` on google.com to generate hints only for clickable search results of a given query
        - -br deprecated, use `-qb` instead

    Excepting the custom selector mode and background hint mode, each of these hint modes is available by default as `;<option character>`, so e.g. `;y` to yank a link's target; `;g<option character>` starts rapid hint mode for all modes where it makes sense, and some others.

    To open a hint in the background, the default bind is `F`.

    Related settings:
        - "hintchars": "hjklasdfgyuiopqwertnmzxcvb"
        - "hintfiltermode": "simple" | "vimperator" | "vimperator-reflow"
        - "relatedopenpos": "related" | "next" | "last"
        - "hintuppercase": "true" | "false"
        - "hintnames": "short" | "uniform" | "numeric"

          With "short" names, Tridactyl will generate short hints that
          are never prefixes of each other. With "uniform", Tridactyl
          will generate hints of uniform length. In either case, the
          hints are generated from the set in "hintchars".

          With "numeric" names, hints are always assigned using
          sequential integers, and "hintchars" is ignored. This has the
          disadvantage that some hints are prefixes of others (and you
          need to hit space or enter to select such a hint). But it has
          the advantage that the hints tend to be more predictable
          (e.g., a news site will have the same hints for its
          boilerplate each time you visit it, even if the number of
          links in the main body changes).
