# Text layout / rendering on the web
LaTeX is really good at producing beautiful text. HTML/CSS is not. We see no reason why, with powerful modern computers, pages on the web cannot be as good as those in LaTeX.


## Ideas
A first step might be to improve the eBook reader in Calibre. That seems to use web style stuff, inc. CSS.
We might consider contacting Medium, or similar text-based web companies to see if they care.
