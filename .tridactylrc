" " Every line in this file is commented out because in general they're all bad ideas.

" " WARNING: This file defines and runs a command called fixamo_quiet. If you
" " also have a malicious addon that operates on `<all_urls>` installed this
" " will allow it to steal your firefox account credentials!
" "
" " With those credentials, an attacker can read anything in your sync account,
" " publish addons to the AMO, etc, etc.
" "
" " Without this command a malicious addon can steal credentials from any site
" " that you visit that is not in the restrictedDomains list.
" "
" " You should comment out the fixamo lines unless you are entirely sure that
" " they are what you want.
" "
" " The advantage of running the command is that you can use the tridactyl
" " interface on addons.mozilla.org and other restricted sites.
" 
" " Provided only as an example.
" " Do not install/run without reading through as you may be surprised by some
" " of the settings.
" 
" " May require the latest beta builds.
" 
" " Uncomment the lines you want to keep then move this file to 
" " $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tridactyl/tridactylrc (that's
" " ~/.config/tridactyl/tridactylrc to mere mortals) or ~/.tridactylrc and
" " install the native messenger (:installnative in Tridactyl). Run :source to
" " get it in the browser, or just restart.
" 
" " If you're bovine3dom run sed 's|^" ||' .tridactylrc > ~/.config/tridactyl/tridactylrc
